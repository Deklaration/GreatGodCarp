function README_DyLiquid() {
	/*
	Create an object like o_water and o_lava from this demo and use these three base scripts:

	dyliquid_init — for Create event;
	dyliquid_update — for Step event;
	dyliquid_draw — for Draw event;

	One instance for one liquid.
	If you need more than one liquid in room, create an instance for each.

	For better performance you can adjust dyliquid_set_quality.
	Also, good decision is to call update and draw only if water inside of camera view.

	For additional documentation look up at each script commentary.
